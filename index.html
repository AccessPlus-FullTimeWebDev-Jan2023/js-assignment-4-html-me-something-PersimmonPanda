               <h2>Helping Others</h2>
               <p id = "testP" class = "funParagraph">Helping people has always been very important to me. When I was five years old, I sincerely believed I wanted to be a dentist, because whenever I went, it wasn't scary or anxiety-inducing. The staff were nice, I was complimented for how nice my teeth were, and I got to choose the flavor of the molding they made of my teeth (like everyone does). I believe I internalized that I wanted to help others, from that moment on, even though I wasn't consciously aware of the why. Since then, anything I do, say, think, is geared toward helping others. Whether "help" comes in the form of knowledge, emotional support, physical help, or making things--I want to make others' lives easier.</p>

               <h2>Ideas</h2>
               <p>Over the last few years, I've had many ideas for how I could improve things for others. I've wanted to make an app or a blog; I've looked at businesses, and thought of physical improvements to their buildings or virtual improvments to their sites; and even down to minor, personal things, thinking of how things work, the physics behind why something doesn't work or will fall, and then making adjustments accordingly. The ideas have varied regarding clothes, cars, electronics, building accessibility, etc.</p>

               <h2>What I've Learned</h2>
               <p>I decided to take this class, in order to learn how to create my own app or website, and even though I'm learning how difficult a task that actually is, it is a worthwhile endeavor. I liked an idea I heard about automating a part of the coding process, as relates to unit-testing, but that's not a skill I have yet. Someday. When I finish this course, and either succeed in getting a job in tech, or I make an app, maybe I'll talk about that.</p>
